## Introduction 

__Importance:__ Using hospital quality ratings, patients are able to make a better decision in what hospital they want to be treated and where the best care is available in state of California, based on overall hospital performance or based on particular medical condition or procedure. 

__Question:__ Can we predict hospital quality ratings based on risk adjusted mortality rates, number of deaths, number of cases, medical procedures performed and medical conditions treated for 2012-2013?

## Description of Data Set

__Dataset:__ is available from [California Hospital Inpatient Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings, 2012-2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Healthcare/California-Hospital-Inpatient-Mortality-Rates-and-/rpkf-ugbp). 

__Description of dataset:__ The dataset contains risk-adjusted mortality rates, and number of deaths and cases for 6 medical conditions treated (Acute Stroke, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Hip Fracture and Pneumonia) and 6 procedures performed (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Carotid Endarterectomy, Craniotomy, Esophageal Resection, Pancreatic Resection, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in California hospitals for 2012 and 2013. This dataset does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings.

__Load the data from csv file.__ 
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/postdoc/Dropbox (Personal)/SpringBoard Fund/Rprojects/")
data <- read.csv("California_Hospital_Inpatient_Mortality_Rates_and_Quality_Ratings__2012-2013.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
df <- tbl_df(data)
```

__Dataset:__ __`r nrow(df)`__ observations and __`r ncol(df)`__ variables. 

__Variables with missing values:__

- Risk Adjusted Mortality Rate: The Risk Adjusted Mortality Rates (RAMR) presented here adjusts the observed mortality rates. This statistical methodology takes into account pre-existing health problems that put some patients at greater risk of death to level the playing field and allow fair comparisons across hospitals; __`r length(df$Risk.Adjusted.Mortality.Rate[is.na(df$Risk.Adjusted.Mortality.Rate)])`__ missing values.
- Number of Deaths: Number of patients that died in this hospital; __`r length(df$X..of.Deaths[is.na(df$X..of.Deaths)])`__ missing values.
- Number of Cases: Number of patients that had this medical procedure or condition in this hospital; __`r length(df$X..of.Cases[is.na(df$X..of.Cases)])`__ missing values.

__Remove missing values, because number of missing values consists of half of dataset.__
```{r}
df_clean <- df[which(is.na(df$X..of.Cases)==F),]
```

__Clean Dataset:__ __`r nrow(df_clean)`__ observations and __`r ncol(df_clean)`__ variables. 

__Variables with no missing values:__

- Year: __`r length(df_clean$Year[df_clean$Year==2012])`__ values for 2012 year and __`r length(df_clean$Year[df_clean$Year==2013])`__ values for 2013 year. 
- County: __55__ counties.
- Hospital: __341__ hospitals. 
- OSHPDID: A unique number established by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) for identifying facilities and used in the Licensed Facility Information System (LFIS). The first three numbers identify the type of facility, the next two represent the county number, and the last five are randomly assigned within each county. 570261 unique codes. 
- Longitude: __Longitude__ of hospital. 
- Latitude: __Latitude__ of hospital.
- location1: __333__ levels. 
- Hospital Ratings: Comparison rating based on a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). If a hospitals upper CI is less than the statewide observed rate, it is designated as performing better than the average hospital. If a hospitals lower CI is greater than the state rate, it is designated as performing worse than the average state hospital. __3 levels of Hospital Ratings:__ As Expected, Better and Worse.
```{r}
summary(df_clean$Hospital.Ratings)
```

- Procedure.Condition: Procedure that was performed or condition that was treated. __6__ medical __procedures__ performed: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair, Carotid Endarterectomy, Craniotomy, Esophageal Resection, Pancreatic Resection, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. __6__ medical __conditions__ treated: Acute Stroke, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Hip Fracture and Pneumonia. Clean dataset contains __17 levels, instead of 12.__ 
```{r}
summary(df_clean$Procedure.Condition)
```

__Decoding Procedure.Condition variable.__

According to the American Stroke Association (ASA), strokes can be classified into 2 main categories: __87%__ are ischemic strokes, caused by blockage of an artery; __13%__ are hemorrhagic strokes, caused by bleeding. Ischemic strokes are further divided into 2 groups: thrombotic and embolic strokes. Hemorrhagic strokes are divided into 2 main categories: intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages. 

Our clean dataset has four categories for Acute Stroke: 

- Acute Stroke: 617 observations;
- Acute Stroke Hemorrhagic: 466 observations;
- Acute Stroke Ischemic: 615 obervations;
- Acute Stroke Subarachnoid: 241 observations.

Within each hospital, there are different notations for Acute Stroke variable. It suggests that different doctor uses different notations for the condition. These four categories are combined in one: Acute Stroke. 
```{r}
df_clean$Procedure.Condition <- gsub("Acute Stroke .*","Acute Stroke",df_clean$Procedure.Condition)
df_clean$Procedure.Condition <- factor(df_clean$Procedure.Condition)
```

Two additional categories are present in Procedure.Condition variable:

- Pancreatic Cancer: 142 observations;
- Pancreatic Other: 130 observations. 

These categories are separate medical conditions and are not combined in one category. 

The Procedure.Condition variable contains 6 medical procedures and 8 medical conditions. To indicate what procedure was performed or what condition was treated, the Medical_Category variable was added to the clean dataset. 

```{r}
df_clean <- df_clean %>% 
  mutate(Medical_Category = ifelse(grepl("Repair",Procedure.Condition) | grepl("Endarterectomy",Procedure.Condition) | grepl("Craniotomy",Procedure.Condition) | grepl("Resection",Procedure.Condition) | grepl("PCI",Procedure.Condition),               "Procedure", "Condition"))
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
df_clean <- df_clean %>% mutate(ratings =
           ifelse(grepl("As Expected",Hospital.Ratings),"0",                        
           ifelse(grepl("Better",Hospital.Ratings),"1",
           ifelse(grepl("Worse",Hospital.Ratings),"-1",NA))))
df_clean$ratings <- as.numeric(df_clean$ratings)
```

### __Predictions__

__Approach__

- Predict hospital quality ratings using __random forests and classification decision trees__. 
- Train the models and evaluate the model performances on 2012 training data.
- Test the model performances on 2013 test data. 

#### Hospital Ratings Prediction Using Random Forests for Dataset in __Wide__ Format.

__Cleanning the Data Set and converting to the wide format based on Procedure.Condition and Risk.Adjusted.Mortality.Rate variables.__
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# convert data to the wide format
df_wide <- df_clean %>% select(Year,Hospital,Latitude,Longitude,Procedure.Condition,Hospital.Ratings,Risk.Adjusted.Mortality.Rate) %>% spread(Procedure.Condition,Risk.Adjusted.Mortality.Rate) 
# remove white spaces from column names
colnames(df_wide) <- gsub(" ","",colnames(df_wide))
# replace NA with 0, because some hospitals does not treat these conditions, thus mortality rate is zero. 
df_wide[is.na(df_wide)] <- 0
```

__Split the Data Set into 2012 training and 2013 test sets.__
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
train_wide <- df_wide[which(df_wide$Year==2012),]
test_wide_original <- df_wide[which(df_wide$Year==2013),]
test_wide <- subset(test_wide_original, select = -Hospital.Ratings)
```

#### Hospital Ratings Prediction Using Classification Decision Trees (CART).

__Model 1: All variables are included in tree construction.__
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
set.seed(34)
tree0 <- rpart(Hospital.Ratings ~ AAARepair + AcuteStroke + AMI + CarotidEndarterectomy + Craniotomy + EsophagealResection + GIHemorrhage + HeartFailure + HipFracture + PancreaticCancer + PancreaticOther + PancreaticResection + PCI + Pneumonia, data = train_wide, method = "class",control=rpart.control(cp=0.001)) 
printcp(tree0)
num <- which.min(tree0$cptable[,"xerror"])
tree0$cptable[num,]
cp.choice<-tree0$cptable[num,"CP"]
pruned.tree<-prune(tree0, cp=cp.choice)
fancyRpartPlot(pruned.tree)
```

__Predictions__ on __test_wide__ dataset.
```{r}
# Make predictions on the test set
prediction <- predict(pruned.tree, test_wide, type = "class")
# confusion matrix
cm <- as.matrix(table(Actual = test_wide_original$Hospital.Ratings,Predicted = prediction))
cm

call_a <- sum(diag(cm))/sum(cm)
call_e <- 1 - sum(diag(cm))/sum(cm)
```

- Accuracy: `r call_a` 
- Error Rate: `r call_e`


__Model 2: AMI, GIHemorrhage and HeartFailure variables are included in tree construction.__
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
tree1 <- rpart(Hospital.Ratings ~ AMI + GIHemorrhage + HeartFailure, data = train_wide, method = "class",control=rpart.control(cp=0.001)) # cp determines when the splitting up of the decision tree stops
printcp(tree1)
num <- which.min(tree1$cptable[,"xerror"])
tree1$cptable[num,]
cp.choice<-tree1$cptable[num,"CP"]
pruned.tree1<-prune(tree1, cp=cp.choice)
fancyRpartPlot(pruned.tree1)
```

__Predictions__ on __test_wide__ dataset.
```{r}
# Make predictions on the test set
prediction <- predict(pruned.tree1, test_wide, type = "class")
# confusion matrix
cm <- as.matrix(table(Actual = test_wide_original$Hospital.Ratings,Predicted = prediction))
cm

c3_a <- sum(diag(cm))/sum(cm)
c3_e <- 1 - sum(diag(cm))/sum(cm)
```

- Accuracy: `r c3_a`

__Conclusions 3:__ 

- __Accuracy on the test data set using__
    - Random Forests with all variables: `r round(rf_a,4)`
    - CART with all variables: `r round(call_a,4)`
    - CART with three variables: `r round(c3_a,4)`
- __Random forests__ gives the best performance, however is not good enough to predict hospitals with the best care in future. 
- __Random forests__ predicts that classification of __hospital ratings__ depend on __conditions and not procedures__ with the most severe patient outcomes.

### __Future Work__

- Predict hospital quality ratings using __multinomial logistic regression__. 
    - Train the model and evaluate the model performance on 2012 training data.
    - Test the model performance on 2013 test data. 
- Compare three models: random forests, classification decision trees and multinomial logistic regression.
    - Summarize which model gives the best performance on 2012 training data and on 2013 test data. 
    - Choose the best model and test its performance on [2014 test data](http://oshpd.ca.gov/HID/Products/PatDischargeData/AHRQ/iqi-imi_overview.html). 
- Recommend which hospitals will have the best care in future using predicted hospital ratings.
